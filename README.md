## Motivation
The debate over the greatest basketball player of all time is an age-old one, and it's a topic I frequently discuss with friends. More often than not, the conversation turns to comparing two of the sport's most iconic figures: Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. As someone who prefers a data-driven approach to sports debates, I felt the need for an easily accessible database that consolidates statistics and achievements of these two legends. This project was born out of that desire.

## The challenges this project addresses include:

+ Data Fragmentation: Stats and data about these players are scattered across various sources, making it hard to quickly reference during a heated debate.
+ Data Consistency: Different datasets might have different formats or columns. Merging them into a single, cohesive database ensures a uniform perspective.
+ Ease of Access: In the heat of a debate, it's essential to pull up relevant data quickly. This project aims to create a unified database to facilitate rapid data retrieval.
+ Objective Analysis: Emotions can run high in sports debates. Having a data-driven database offers an objective foundation for any argument.

## Features

+ Data Importing: Seamless import of multiple datasets like advanced stats, game highs, per-game stats, and more.
+ Data Merging: Identify datasets with the 'Season' and 'Player' columns and merge them for a unified view.
+ Statistical Analysis: In-depth analysis of both players' careers, including game performances and career achievements.

## Technologies Used

+ Pandas: A powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python.
+ SQLite: A C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
+ Plotly: A Python graphing library to make interactive, publication-quality graphs online.
