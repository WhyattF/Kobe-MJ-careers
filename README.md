## Motivation
The debate over the greatest basketball player of all time is an age-old one, and it's a topic I frequently discuss with friends. More often than not, the conversation turns to comparing two of the sport's most iconic figures: Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. As someone who prefers a data-driven approach to sports debates, I felt the need for an easily accessible database that consolidates statistics and achievements of these two legends. This project was born out of that desire.
